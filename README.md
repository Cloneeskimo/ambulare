# Game

### Overview

Game is a video game with an incredibly original name. It runs on Java, and relies on LWJGL.

### Building

I use Maven to build the project and IntelliJ to develop it. The pom.xml file with all the necessary libraries is included in the repository. Simply import this repo as a Maven project in IntelliJ and it should work right off the bat.
